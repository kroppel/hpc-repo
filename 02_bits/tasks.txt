3. Have a look at the documentation of FMLA (vector).
What did we just accomplish through the example above?

The given example value of 'i_vec_instr' is equal to the
generic instruction format of the FMLA instruction that
operates on SIMD&FP registers. The bits that identify
the two source registers and the destination register
are all set to 0. What the implemented function now does
is that it takes the information for the three registers
as well as the instruction itself as input, and it inserts
the register identifiers into the instruction.
