# Serie 7
## Aufgabenstellung:

### 7.1 Loop over M


1. Implement and verify the matrix kernel C += AB for M=128, N=6, K=48, ldA=128, ldB=48, ldC=128. Re-use the code of your microkernel, implemented in Section 7.2.  

2. Optimize your matrix kernel. Respect the rules of Section 7.2. Report and document your optimizations.  

3. Submit the metrics “time (s)”, “#executions”, “GFLOPS” and “%peak” together with your team name for your best-performing variant.
